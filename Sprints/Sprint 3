In this week, Igho Started to create Order table and tried to insert into DestinationDatabase but had some errors and Igho asked me to check
that code. The error showing that there is a SQL syntax errors happen, so I check every SQL command and try to find some errors there. I found
some small problem and made some changes but the error still can not be fixed.
