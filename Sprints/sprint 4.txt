After so much problems in getting the order dimension to function as it should, i eventually got a breakthrough at the drop in session where with toms help i was able to identify a missed comma between the column names in the SQL insert statement. after taking this off, the code worked alright and was able to insert into the orderDimension. However, i and my team members came to a conclusion to drop the idea of adding the order dimension as it will be time consuming and will not fetch us any extra marks. Zhaofeng however did work on the facttable for this week. Also Wehong and Zhaofeng were in charge of creating the dashboard while i and adjete have kept plugging with the getall dimensions
