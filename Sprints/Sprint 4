In this week, we went to the drop in session and showed the problems we have to Tom and asked for help. I finished lab 10 which talks about
visualsing data, but after I run the program and found that there are no data showed. After I read the code carefully, I found the data are 
getting from fact table but I did nothing in the fact table in my memory. So I review lab 9 which did something relate to fact table and 
realise that that is the why the code have finished. I need to carry on lab 9 so that I can design dashboard.
