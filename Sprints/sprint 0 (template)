Wenhong went through the lab 8 which is insert data into database and done it for "customer" as well in CustomerBranchLab8 branch just for 
practice, although the programmer is Adjete (for "customer" coding) this week. There was a error in line 144 in Form1.cs said the index out
of range. Have no idea to fix it because the index is correct in my view.
