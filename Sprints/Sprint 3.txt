This week i kept going with trying to get the orderDimension to work. Had loads of problems with getting the code to first split off the order/ship dates which my team members eventually helped me out with. I got the dates to split and then got stuck with trying to get the code to insert into the database (order table) which i added by modifying the db locally. still coult not get it to work.
